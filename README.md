1. This version of the project focuses on a python code which connects to multiple smartphone ip's, & copies the "document" folder from the ip address, 
which contains all the databases (db) from the Smart Galshan (SG) to a local directory in a computer.

2. Next, the code goes over the copied DBs in the local directory specified, and collects the neccessary data in order to show analysis from the SG activity.

3. Then, it shows the data in a pandas dataframe from the dbs copied from each smartphones ip address.

4. Afterwards, the data is copied as an excel spreadsheet.
